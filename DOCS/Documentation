Currently the debate is between using session[] variables and utilizing a class to manage the
pause times processing.  The class instance seems to work better than session[] vars.
I am wondering if it would be beneficial to limit the session[] vars to flask related needs 
only and build up the PauseCalc() class (helpers.py) to completely handle all other related 
furnace and logging data into an overall Furnace() class, leaving flask completely for application 
functions alone.
This seems like a more ideal way to manage the data and system overall.
